# Mapping-Census-Data

This was a project for the [Sonrai R Users MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/sonRai/events/265838349/) on November 14th 2019. A data visualisation competition was held for the meet up and competitors had a choice of 3 data sets. I chose the Garda districts data set which consists numbers of crimes in various categories reported at Garda Divisions and their stations around the country between 2010 and the beginning of 2016. Dataset is available at [Open Data - data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/crimes-at-garda-stations-level-2010-2016)

In order to map the data onto a map of Garda Divisions the ESRI Shape (SHP) files for Garda Divsions at [Census Boundary Files](https://www.cso.ie/en/census/census2011boundaryfiles/) are required.
